# Clinical Trial Data Analysis using Python

## Objective
To analyze simulated clinical trial data using Python for evaluating patient demographics, adverse events, and treatment outcomes.

## Dataset
A simulated clinical trial dataset containing patient demographics, treatment group allocation, adverse event occurrence, and outcome scores.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab

## Analysis Performed
- Data understanding and cleaning
- Demographic analysis
- Adverse event (safety) analysis
- Treatment-wise outcome analysis
- Data visualization

## Key Insights
- Balanced distribution of patients across treatment groups
- Comparable adverse event frequency between Drug A and Drug B
- Drug B showed slightly higher mean outcome score

## Relevance to Pharma-IT
This project demonstrates the application of Python-based data analytics in clinical research and pharma IT environments, supporting safety and efficacy decision-making.
